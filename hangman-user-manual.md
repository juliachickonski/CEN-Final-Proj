# Hangman User Manual 

Version 2.0

## Getting Started

In 6 simple steps:  
1. Run the program downloaded from the repository.  
2. When the menu opens, using your arrow keys to navigate, click 'Play Hangman' from the list of options.  
3. There will now be 3 difficulty options to choose from, simply pick one to begin. 
4. You'll now be shown the hangman environment, where you can begin 'guessing' the word by pressing a letter key on your keyboard (no need to click `enter`).
5. As you go, used letters will be put into the wordbank, and you can continue guessing new letters to complete the word. 
6. Once completed or failed, you can click `Enter` to go back to the hangman menu when prompted. 
  

## Tips

1. The hangman difficulty drastically changes how each wrong letter effects your lives, so be sparing and take your time to think of the right word.
2. Use the hints given in the menu to focus into one category (Animals, etc).
