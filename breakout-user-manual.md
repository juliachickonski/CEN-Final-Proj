# Breakout User Manual 

Version 2.0

## Getting Started

In 5 simple steps:  
1. Run the program downloaded from the repository.  
2. When the menu opens, using your arrow keys to navigate, click 'Play Breakout' from the list of options.  
3. The game will initially be paused to start, begin by pressing your `spacebar`.
4. Move your paddle with `WASD`, and attempt to keep the ball from touching the floor. 
5. To exit at any time, press `X`.  
  

## Tips

1. The paddle **accelerates** according to your input, meaning it's best to control how long you press your directional keys.
2. We'd reccomend you try and predict where the ball is going to go so as to move the paddle there before the ball reaches the floor.
